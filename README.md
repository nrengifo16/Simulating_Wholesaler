# Simulating_Wholesaler
This project seeks to apply a discrete event simulation model to represent the chain of
activities present in a wholesale distribution center, in order to optimize the time that
customers remain in the establishment.For this, an optimization simulation strategy is
used through the OptQuest by SIMUL8, and additionally to improve the behavior of
the model, input and output data analyzes are performed, as well as the respective
sensitivity analysis, all through implementation in SIMUL8 Professional 2020.
Keywords: DES, Discrete event simulation, wholesale distribution center
